*Welcome to the So Pekocko API*.

To create the application proceed as follows!

To start, clone the following repo into a folder.
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6

To make the project work, you need to install :
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in version 12.14 or 14.0Â
